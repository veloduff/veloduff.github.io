<img src="/assets/images/oatmeal_stout_01.jpg" alt="8bit Blackout Oatmeal Stout" width="300px">

This is my version of Modern Times Black House Stout. 

### Recipe Specs

- **Batch Size**: 19 liters
- **Original Gravity**: 1.060 SG
- **Final Gravity**: 1.018 SG
- **ABV**: 5.5%
- **IBU**: 26.4

### Grain Bill

- 3.50 kg Crisp Finest Maris Otter Ale Malt (69.0%) *can be hard to find*

### Hops

- 42.5g East Kent Goldings (4.5% AA) at 75 min

### Water Treatment

Tap water where I live is good for IPAs, but that's about it. For this recipe, I used a 50/50 mix of garage tap water and reverse osmosis water, then added:
- 2.65g Calcium Chloride
- 2.26g Baking Soda
- 0.80g Gypsum (Calcium Sulfate)

### Yeast

- White Labs WLP002 English Ale Yeast


### Coffee Addition

The signature element of this stout is the coffee addition:
- 2.00 oz Illy Medium Roast crushed, added to primary fermentation for 24 hours

I chose Illy Medium Roast for its balanced flavor profile. 

## Brewing Process

I brewed this on my 20-liter Braumeister system:

1. Mash at 67°C (153°F) for 60 minutes
2. Sparge to collect 24.4 liters of wort
3. Boil for 75 minutes, adding hops at the beginning
4. Chill to 18°C (64°F) and pitch yeast
5. Ferment at 19°C (66°F) for 10 days
6. Add coffee for the final 24 hours of fermentation
7. Force carbonate for 3 days 

## Tasting Notes

This beer pours deep black. The aroma features coffee prominently, backed by dark chocolate, and roasted grain.

On the palate, the oats provide a silky mouthfeel that carries flavors of espresso, bittersweet chocolate, and roasted malt. The finish is moderately dry with lingering coffee notes and a hint of caramel sweetness.

At 5.5% ABV, you can drink more than one.
